# File Interceptor (Python) — Lab Project

## Overview
This repository is a **template** for a file-interception project intended **only for educational use** in a controlled lab environment.
It provides documentation, structure, and supporting files — **no interception or exploit code is included**.

A “file interceptor” lab typically demonstrates how unencrypted file transfers on a local network could be observed or altered.  
This project is designed strictly for **isolated test networks** where you have explicit permission.

---

## ⚠️ Legal & Safety Notice
Intercepting files or traffic on networks you do **not** own or lack explicit permission to monitor is **illegal and unethical**.  
This repository deliberately omits any runnable code.  
Use it only for defensive research or classroom labs.

---

## What this repo provides
- Structured README and documentation.
- `requirements.txt` listing common Python libraries used in lab interception or monitoring.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) for open educational use.
- `file_interceptor.py.example` — a placeholder file (no runnable code) for your own lab implementation.

---

## Suggested Lab Features
*(Conceptual only — not implemented here)*  
- Monitor a specified network interface for file-transfer protocols (e.g. HTTP, FTP in a lab).  
- Log metadata (file names, sizes) for analysis.  
- Demonstrate risks of sending files over unencrypted channels.  
- Provide optional alerts or summaries for defensive testing.

---

## Requirements (for lab experimentation)
If you later add your own lab code, these Python packages are commonly used:
- scapy
- pyshark
- dpkt

See `requirements.txt` for pinned versions.

---

## Usage (High-level, non-actionable)
1. Set up an isolated lab or virtual network.
2. Obtain explicit permission from all participants.
3. Add your own monitoring or logging logic inside `file_interceptor.py.example` (keep it private if necessary).
